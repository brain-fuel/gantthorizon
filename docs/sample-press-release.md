# Press Release — Compass & Frame Announces Gantt Horizon

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Compass & Frame Launches Gantt Horizon, the Jira-Native Scheduling Engine that Makes Roadmaps Trustworthy**

*San Francisco, CA – [Insert Date]* — Compass & Frame today unveiled **Gantt Horizon**, a Forge-powered project scheduling engine that converts raw Jira issues into dependable delivery plans by combining top-down scheduling windows, bottom-up PERT aggregation, and resource-aware critical-path analysis. Built for leaders who live inside Atlassian, Gantt Horizon keeps plans honest the moment work changes.

Following Compass & Frame’s working-backwards philosophy, the MVP centers on business outcomes. Initiatives flow down into start windows for every child issue; Stories, Bugs, and Tasks roll their PERT triads upward; and the critical path stays visible in Jira without manual spreadsheets or external Gantt tools.

> **“Stakeholders shouldn’t have to reconcile half a dozen reports to know where things stand,” said Matt Halpern, founder of Compass & Frame. “Gantt Horizon keeps the plan, the risks, and the confidence bands inside Jira—so leaders can course-correct while the team keeps moving.”**

## Key Capabilities Delivered on Day One

- **Two-Way Timeflow:** Strategic start windows cascade from epics and initiatives down to every leaf. Leaf estimates bubble back up, recalculating parent timelines immediately.
- **Automatic Critical Path & Slack Insight:** Gantt Horizon highlights the issues that determine delivery, exposing slack and buffers without leaving Jira.
- **Resource-Aware Planning:** Assign work to squads or role pools and let the engine respect capacity, surfacing overcommitment before it becomes a crisis.
- **Confidence Bands in Plain Language:** Instead of cryptic “P50/P90,” managers see “Most-likely finish” and “90% confident finish” with clear, stakeholder-friendly explanations.
- **Smart Recompute Cadence:** Immediate recalculations keep daily planning accurate, while scheduled sweeps guarantee data integrity after large imports or bursts of change.

## Customer Response

Compass & Frame’s pilot customers report halving status-prep effort and converting weekly readouts into real strategic conversations. “When a team updates a story, the entire initiative view stays honest. We stopped guessing,” noted a beta Product Director.

## Built on Atlassian Forge

Gantt Horizon installs directly into Atlassian Cloud sites. It honors existing Jira workflows, permissions, and automation while layering enterprise-grade scheduling intelligence on top.

## Availability

Gantt Horizon is available today in Early Access under Compass & Frame’s portfolio. General availability with portfolio dashboards, Monte Carlo simulations, and workspace-level resource balancing arrives in Q3.
